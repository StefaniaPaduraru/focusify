# Focusify Project ðŸ’¡

## Overview

The Focusify project is inspired by the Microsoft To-Do application. It represents a web application that utilizes React, where the user can note their daily tasks, update their calendar with activities, or learn using the Pomodoro technique.

## What I Learned

Throughout the project, I learned and utilized various technologies and concepts such as Bootstrap, React Router, components, hooks, local storage, forms, props, classes, and events.
